# World-Cup-Vizuals
***

## Summary
I worked on this project during the 2018 World Cup as it was an event that captivated me. As a former soccer player and someone who can appreciate an event which brings the entire world together - I set out to explore trends in world cup data. The project was done mainly using Pandas, Plotly and Seaborn in Python. Thank you to Sowmya (https://github.com/sowmya0627) for the partnership on this project. 


## Insights

![average age](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31706194/43032120-27145f58-8c64-11e8-88ad-e674aa98aa2c.png)

The green line corresponds to the average age of all players in the world cup. All teams' have an average age range between 25 and 29.
Interestingly, all of the final 4 teams (England, Belgium, Croatia, and France) are young (below the average age). France, the winner, was the youngest team in the World Cup.

![loyalty heatmap](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31706194/43031750-ca10b9b6-8c5c-11e8-8844-9a3e065aa0da.png)

Players tend to gravitate to the major clubs in Europe (England, France, Germany, Italy, Spain). This can be observed by the vertical bands in the heatmap. This can be explained by the fact that European leagues are the most competative teams and there is the most money availible for top players.
If players aren't in Europe, they tend to play for their home country. This can be observed on the main Diagonal.


## Next Steps
I would like to expand the analysis to include preformance in games (wins, goals scored, goals saved) based on physical traits, explore specific country vs. country matchups, and also see how teams do when they are the host nation, compared to their historical average.
